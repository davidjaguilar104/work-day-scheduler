# Work Day Scheduler

## Description 
I wanted to build an application that helps users stay on track with tasks they may need to complete! I did this by creating the "Work Day Scheduler". This application will display the current day, along with time blocks for a user to input whatever task they desire, at any time through the work day! The time blocks also have a save icon next to them to persist the tasks on the page, even when reloaded. The scheduler also has color coded time blocks. For instance, green block for a time in the future, red for the current hour, and grey for the past! I was also able to showcase my skills with jQuery and Moment.js.
